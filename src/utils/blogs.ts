      "Data science is the practice of mining large data sets of raw data, both structured and unstructured, to identify patterns and extract actionable insight from them. This is an interdisciplinary field, and the foundations of data science include statistics, inference, computer science, predictive analytics, machine learning algorithm development, and new technologies to gain insights from big data.",
      "To define data science and improve data science project management, start with its life cycle. The first stage in the data science pipeline workflow involves capture: acquiring data, sometimes extracting it, and entering it into the system. The next stage is maintenance, which includes data warehousing, data cleansing, data processing, data staging, and data architecture.",
      "Data processing follows, and constitutes one of the data science fundamentals. It is during data exploration and processing that data scientists stand apart from data engineers. This stage involves data mining, data classification and clustering, data modeling, and summarizing insights gleaned from the data.",
